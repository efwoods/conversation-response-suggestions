I am creating a conversation suggestion response web app. I want this to be available with mobile. 

 This application runs in react, it displays audio at the top of the screen and provides a scroll - wheel of conversation response suggestions at the bottom of the screen. The user can also type responses and those responses are audibly played. When the user selects a response, that response is audibly played. The responses intermittently update and expand on hover. There is a wake effect on click. There is an option to allow ecog or eeg data file formats to be sent instead of text input & and the parsed eeg data as text is displayed as one of the options, made larger, focused on, and played audibly. The app will listen to audio, parse the audio into text, and display the text as a endless stock ticker live scrolling mechanism at the top of the screen as discussed before. This app may be used in horizontal or landscape mode. It is modular to allow for the calling of apis.
