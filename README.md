# convsersation-response-suggestions

This will actively listen for conversations and suggest responses in real-time. It will optionally play audio in the voice of a particular individual. The responses are customizable to a LangChain database.

## Motivation
I want to create an application to listen to a conversation and give me options to respond in my own voice based on historical texts that I have written. I want to include Langchain, SadTalker (modularly to be replaced by Elevenlabs), whisper by open-ai, VAD. I want to be able to use this in real time. This is a part of an application that allows for a person to create a custom model and speak to that individual if custom content is loaded into the service. I want this to  be deployable as a docker container and deployable on the web and I want it to be able to run in real time and also be used on my  phone and watch. Please. I think this would be helpful for people that cannot currently speak, and for people that want to speak to people that are not available. 


## Roadmap
This is the foundation for a fully functioning, modular, and real-time voice response application that:

    1. Listens in real time (via WebSocket) using browser or microphone input.

    2. Detects speech boundaries using Silero Voice Activity Detection (VAD).

    3. Transcribes audio using OpenAI's Whisper (open-source).

    4. Suggests a personal response using LangChain and a vector database built from your own historical texts.

    5. Synthesizes speech with SadTalker (can be swapped out with ElevenLabs or any TTS).

    6. Runs inside Docker, ready to be deployed to web, desktop, mobile, and eventually wearable interfaces.

Hereâ€™s what we will do next:

- [ ] Add Silero VAD logic (vad.py)

- [ ] Add Whisper-based transcription module (transcribe.py)

- [ ] Build LangChain response generator from your own text corpus (respond.py)

- [ ] Add SadTalker wrapper (tts.py)

- [ ] Create vectorstore ingestion tool from your personal writings

- [ ] Write Dockerfile and deployment scripts

    - [ ] Add WebRTC/MediaRecorder support for mobile/phone and watch compatibility

Shall I go ahead and implement the next part (vad.py for Silero)?
